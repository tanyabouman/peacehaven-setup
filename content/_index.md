Peace Haven was organized by deacon representatives of Brantford, Dundas, Hamilton, St. George, St. Thomas and several elected members to support families who are caring for family members with disabilities.

Several members of Free Reformed congregations live in two Peace Haven homes and are supported by trained staff who help them develop programs to enrich their lives and support them to function to their fullest potential.

The Board thanks the churches, individuals and many volunteers who donated funds, material and labour for renovations, furniture, appliances, household items and groceries,&mdash;too many things to mention. The young people and the families who continue to offer friendship and respite care are also a real blessing.
